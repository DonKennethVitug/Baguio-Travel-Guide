    "history": "Baguio City's famed White House was the ancestral home of the Laperal Family. Some time after it was abandoned, word spread that it was haunted, and that strange noises emanate from its premises at night and that spirits could be seen moving around. Late last year (2013), it was converted and transformed into what is now reportedly the country's first and only BAMBOO MUSEUM, housing incredible works of art done on bamboo poles by skilled Ifugao craftsmen. It is indeed almost inconceivable how these extremely talented wood carvers (led by low-key ROLDAN PAIT of the Asin Bamboo Carvers Guild) were able to do such intricate and detailed works on singular bamboo poles. You really have to see it to believe it. With an entrance fee of just fifty pesos, there simply is no reason for you not to go there. Picture-taking is allowed. And visitors are even permitted to explore the upper floors of this erstwhile haunted house. Who knows, there might be some spirits still lurking there. Surely, you don’t want to miss Baguio's newest attraction!"

Don't expect much from boating on Burnham Lake; it is anti-climactic at best. It's not much of a lake at all. \"Pool\" would be a more apt title for it. There is nowhere to go except in circles, and the only sights to see beyond the flowerbeds and trees surrounding the pool are the tops of buildings, including city hall, numerous hotels, and SM City shopping mall. The true fun is in the laughter and fellowship you have with friends and family in the boat, and that is what Burnham Lake is truly all about...\"",
